GT-FHIR2: Georgia Tech - OmopOnFHIR Implementation version 2
=
- Supports OMOP v5
- Supports STU3

Database Dependencies
-
This application requires an OMOP V5 database to work. You can use the database here: https://github.com/gt-health/smart-platform-docker/tree/hdap-devops/smart-postgresql
1. First clone the `hdap-devops` branch of the `smart-platform-docker project`
2. Navigate to the `smart-postgres` directory of the project.
   ```
     cd smart-postgres
   ```
3. Look at the docker-compose.yml file and adjust configurations as needed. By default the database is configured to run on port 5438. Use docker-compose to start the container.
   ```
   sudo docker-compose up --build -d
   ```
4. The OMOP V5 database is not running in a container.

How to install and run.
-
Docker Compose is used to create a container to run the GT-FHIR2 application. Before running the application
update the values of the JDBC_URL, JDBC_USERNAME, and JDBC_PASSWORD environment variables in the docker-compose.yml
They must contain the data necessary for your application to connect to an OMOP V5 database.
After updating the docker-compose.yml file start the application
```
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```
